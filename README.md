WEB3 ~ ECOSYSTEM (tech: taxonomy & ontology)

SCALING TRILEMMA - Scaling, Security, decentralization

Two types of ROLLUPS: ZKP or Optimistic 

Optimism and Arbitrum are L2 OPERATORS

 SNARK PROOF

 Snarks Plonk

 State Channel and Side Chain

 DHT Distributed Hash Tables - discovery.

 CID - IPFS

Multi-sig wallet Upgradable, Diamonds

LENS. Livepeer

"Super-Creative Ecosystem of Creative Professionals"

cryptography  Symmetric/Asymmetric RSA PGP GPG Cryptographic access to shared data.
SHA256 DIGITAL SIGNATURE 
HASH  Keccak captures STATE, non modifiable 0x.
ELLIPTIC CURVE

CIRCUIT BREAKERS
SPEED BUMPS - time to happen.
RATE LIMITING

Event Monitoring. Tools to help. DEFENDER and Tenderly (monitors).

Shadowing 

Payable

Frontrunning. Oracle Griefing Force-feeding.

HardFork SoftFork


Decentralization sharding rollups Centralized.

WEB SERVICE model vs CRYPTO SERVICE model

MemPools, Genesis Block, Nonce.

Concentrated (cost structure, production)  vs. Distributed (cost structure, production)

public ledger, 

concesus mechanisms BFT - Byzantine Fault Tolerance Concensus Mechanism PoW PoS

Double Spend Problem

DAO, SmartContract

Tenderly 
Waffle Truffle Hardhat - test and deploy smart contracts

IDEs Remix Foundry

Audits Encode

ethers.js web3.js

Standards OpenZeppelin

Wallet, custody of data

Miners - SYBIL RESISTANCE MECHANISM - determines who PRODUCES BLOCK, limits number of ppl.


Key PEOPLE of CRYPTO:
David Chaum, eCash, DigiCash

Yellow Paper VButerin

LIVENESS (property) BLOCKCHAIN will ALWAYS PROCEED.
Never to become STAGNANT. 

Validator  Beacon Chain

 NODE PROVIDERS run EVM.

 Solidity, Vyper

 ABI bytecode

 "Injected Provider"

 MAINNET TESTNET

 SafeMath safetransfer Ownable Bloom Filter

EVM is ‘stack machine’ also ‘register machine’
256bit stack machine.

NON-MUTABLE Storage.

IPFS FileCoin NFTStorage Pinata. NFTUp.

ZERO KNOWLEDGE PROOFS - Identity. PoK

Zcash - prove transaction is correct, but do not make public sender, receiver, amount
ZkSync: should bring VISA number of TPS to 1000.
No CENTRAL LEGER. All NODES KEEP STATE. - CONCENSUS.

Defi Socialfi Gamefi wifi

Digital Identity SBT

Dynamic Tokens. non-transferrable, upgrades

Access Tokens.

Token Gating

Nomenclature

Lens Protocol Dispatcher - autosigner

Protocol Explosion

self-custody

social-graph: social networks across platforms.

Decentralized Governance

membership

NFT_Marketplaces

PFP , Utility NFTs POAP

Social Protocols Lens Farcaster

tokenization (of physical goods to digital goods)

AI - personalization, ML, NLP.

NFT RECEIPT.

Utility Farming - payout per use not stake.

Poap Farming. Yeild Farming. Curve Wars. Fluidity

liquidity, TVL, liquidity pools, stablecoin (USDT, USDC, DAI)

Yield Protocol (Aave Compound)

wash trading

PRINCIPLES:
minimal-click, faq, extra info tabs: txn state tips, easy acces [?] (write to blockchain, immutable, editable, refundable, etc.)
simplify words, simplify complexity, unbounded web3 design, every txn needs good design, every txn is a UX,
community is core. incentive alignment, 
every token is a ux, every block in every chain is ux. we pioneer web3 design - bloodstar.

P2E - play to earn

crowd fund shibuya.xyz

Web3 game

Proof of humanity

worldcoin 

governance mechanism

fleek.xyz/ vercel

superid, civil resistence "1 cpu 1 vote"

dark forest illuvium, fractal, gala games

Target Audience: STUDENTS PoK and Architect reference.


collectible, mirror 

mirror.xyz, paragraph.xyz, readl, glass.xyz - solana/phantom, sound.xyz

GUILD GATING - content-producer guild  (expirations) or (random-renewals) (second-opinions)

INCLUSIVE and EXCLUSIVE gating.
unbounded and impounded gating.

Anti-Botnet-Design: goodactor badactor - gating : zero-false-positives, zero-true-negatives
- whenever we are of limited ui, or stifled ux - haxors win. Always silent disUX. enUX.
- GATE goodactorin, badactorout by enUX and disUX waterfalls. 

NOT like a fortress to keep baddies out - Like an alpine-mountain-stream of pure water.
Filter badactors like a mountain purifies water, pollutants sink in rocks, sand and swamp, while pure water flows to the top.
That is how to GATE COMMUNITIES from digital wolves.
